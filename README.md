# FilesTransfer in Java 

To run the software, open the already compiled jar in the \bin folder. You can pull the directory to compile it yourself.

Use the config.ini to set some important parameters:
  - uername: the username you want to use while using the network
  - outputdir: the directory you want to save your files in (you need to put a final slash for it to work, for example "C:\users\me\")
  - type10: if you are in network that uses addresses starting with '10.' then set this to true, otherwise set it to false
  - ip: if the software doesn't start, you can try adding the correct local IP of your PC

To send a file, select one or more users in list on the right, then drag and drop one or more files, then click "Send".
